# Traffic-Light-Classifier

In this project, youâ€™ll use your knowledge of computer vision techniques to build a classifier for images of traffic lights! You'll be given a dataset of traffic light images in which one of three lights is illuminated: red, yellow, or green. Your complete classification code should be able to take in an RGB image and output a predicted label for that image.

Criteria
You should submit your project once you meet the following two criteria:

Greater than 90% accuracy
